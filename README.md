# jupyternotebook_covid_19_visualization
## A simple jupyter notebook to perform some data visualization on covid-19 course based on data of Johns Hopkins CSSE Github-Repo, see https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

## Conclusions as of 21.03.2020: 
## 1. The growth rate appears to be exponential at current date.
## 2. It seems to be hard to fit a matching and "long term stable" logistic function to the current data... making predictions is not a good idea (just as I expected)
